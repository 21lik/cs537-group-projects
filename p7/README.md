Status: We completed the main functions for both files and implemented the fuse operation functions for wfs.c. We were able to pass 14 of the 20 tests (0-10, 15-16, 19). We will most likely revise and resubmit later, with a new slipday.txt file.

Files changed:
<ul>
    <li>mkfs.c: Added file, main function for initializing filesystem.</li>
    <li>wfs.c: Added file, main function for mounting disk image, fuse operations, helper functions.</li>
</ul>
